# SQL Command: TRUNCATE TABLE

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command in SQL is used to **remove all records from a table** quickly and efficiently **without deleting the table structure** (i.e., columns, constraints, and schema remain intact).  

Itâ€™s often used when you want to clear a table completely but still keep it available for future data insertion.
