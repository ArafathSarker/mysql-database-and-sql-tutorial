# SQL Query: Using GROUP BY and ORDER BY with Aggregate Functions

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This SQL script demonstrates how to use **aggregate functions** (like `SUM()`) in combination with the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses.  
Itâ€™s a simple example that groups records by the `Age` column in a table called `student` and then sorts the results based on the total (`SUM`) of ages.
