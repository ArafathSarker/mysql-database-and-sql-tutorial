# SQL Concept: VIEW (Virtual Table)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
A **VIEW** in SQL is a **virtual table** based on the result of a `SELECT` query.  
It does not store data itself but displays data stored in other tables.  

Views are commonly used to:
- Show only specific columns or rows to certain users.
- Simplify complex queries.
- Enhance database **security** by restricting access to sensitive columns.

## ðŸ§© Basic Structure

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];
